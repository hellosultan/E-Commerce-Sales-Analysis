🔒 Data Privacy  
- All uploaded CSV files are processed **only in memory**.  
- No data is stored, logged, or shared outside the app session.  
- Once you close or refresh the app, your uploaded data is no longer available.  

This ensures that your data remains private and secure while using the demo.
